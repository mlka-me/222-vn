#ATTENTION! THE CURRENT DESCRIPTION IS A SUBJECT TO CHANGE!
#The structure: in the current structure all topics (except for unwritten ones) are available for viewing.
#However, in the future, the topic structure will go as following:
#TOPICS RELATED TO PLOT will not likely contain choices that increase/decrease(?) affection points, but most likely help you
#learn Kaeya's opinion on things/learn lore.
#TOPICS RELATED TO FEELINGS, FLIRTING (yes, we can rizz Kaeya!), and COMPLIMENTS directly have an impact on Kaeya's affection.
#TOPICS RELATED TO STORIES are NOT CANON AT ALL! It influences nothing XD they are just for fun and curiosity

     k "Unfortunately,{w=0.5} I've seen none of them."

     k "According to some beliefs,{w=0.5} left-handed knights had some kind of devil power."

     k "Personally,{w=0.5} I don't have a single guess about people's way of thinking. But I do have one theory, though."

     k "You've probably heard about right-handed and left-handed people{w=0.5} and it is a common knowledge which group is superior in numbers."

     k "For example,{w=0.5} when training one's bladework, an opponent and trainee must have a weapon in the same hand. Otherwise,{w=0.5} having mastered your weapon in an oppposite hand would be simply considered cheating."

     k "Having access to unique angles makes an easier time defeating their opponent, which would make no sense. Moreover, having less left-handed people means less opponents tailored specifically for them."

     k "So, that's actually why there are no left-handed knights in the Knights of Favonius."

     k "But I would think of another adjective. How about we call them 'impulsive thoughts'?"

     k "As bad as it might be, impulsive thoughts can give you priceless experience you will never probably gain anywhere else."

     k "For example, I've heard a story of someone who decided to share their newborn thoughts to their friends. And their reactions were not the one they expected."

     k "Some even said they contradicted each other and even had some proofs, making the said person more embarrassed."
