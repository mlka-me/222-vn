Seems there is no way to enroll to university. We can't leave the country to get what's needed 'cause the consequences will
be very serious.
Well, if so then I have to work. And if I have to work then from now on I officially announce that I'm the only developer
of "Just Kaeya!" and I'm in charge for a lot of things, including art, music, writing and coding. 
If you will to help me (and if you simp for Kaeya, too) write here:

I hope the family will be big and friendly!
