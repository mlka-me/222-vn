Sorry, I have literally no place to write, especially about my feelings. So, I'll write here. Okay? But not for long, I
promise!
One, two, three... Three, two, one... Breath.

Please tell me how to delete all people on the Earth...
I just want to calm down. I don't know how to concentrate during stress and especially if there are so many people!
"Well... Try to visualize a never ending storm, then imagine... Hmm, no, try to visualize something comfortable for you. 
It will help, especially if your wish doesn't exist now."
But how about something not material?
~~~
Well, the thing is that my parents want me to play MIDI piano, but they completely don't understand where this is going...
I need help, not being overwhelmed with how to set up this piano and which programs are needed!
Oh no, it's a hurricane again! I'm trapped here! Forever! I wish I could grow up without father. Nothing would change!
"Hey, listen, are you about your repressed dreams? Well, let me help you then..."
