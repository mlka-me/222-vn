Why? Why? Why? Why? WHY?????????!!!!!!
 I really can't believe... We have done all of this just for a sake of a 3-star? Were our calculations wrong? Was my bro
lying to me all the time? I suspected... But I couldn't think it can go in the worst way possible...
Well then... NOW I REALLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR A FREAKING DECEMBER TO GET MY DEAR C3 KAEYA! I HAVE WARNED MY BROTHER, I HAVE
WARNED!
 And now... only 1 pull or 160 primogems (why the heck it's so expensive?) divides me from my dream. But I only have 12
primogems...
Should I stay or should I go? I really don't want to worse my health but understanding you have to wait 6 freaking months...
Well, whatever! I have 5 more hours! Let's go to Enkanomia!

They were right after all. I'm tired and really want to sleep. Seems there is really nothing I can change.

Here is a song you can listen to... Well, I hope you will understand my pain.
Sayonara. And sorry for Japanese. It has the same meaning as "goodbye". Seems I'll never see Kaeya ever and ever again.
Am I really that unlucky?
~~~
She's over there... Crying again. I can understand her devotion for the character, but she also needs to care about herself.
I don't want to lose her. If it happens, no one will be happy :(. After all, I have lost too much not to care at all.
"Hey... I really know how much you care and love me in both realities. I can feel your pain, your tears and regrets.
But listen, you are not an Archon or a Goddess of Celestia and oh boy, they do have their own regrets and as people they
make their own mistakes.
Despite all of this you still have a lot of time and things going on. Now you and your state matter more than this. At 
least, that's what one of your friends would surely say even if it were a little bit different.
Just know...
I Still Love You.
Goodnight.
P.S. You will catch another luck again. Just wait!
